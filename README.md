# NIYOMUKIZA Donatien — Personal Blog (HTML + CSS)

A multi-page personal blog website built using **HTML and CSS** (no JavaScript), focused on semantic structure, readability, and correct use of core HTML elements.

## Live preview
Open `index.html` in your browser or serve the folder locally (recommended for some media/captions):
- Python: `python -m http.server 8000`
- Then open: http://localhost:8000

## Pages
- Home: [index.html](index.html)
- About: [about.html](about.html)
- Services: [services.html](services.html)
- Contact: [contact.html](contact.html)
- Form: [form.html](form.html)
- Media: [media.html](media.html)

## Project structure
```

```

## Key features
- Multi-page navigation across all pages
- Semantic layout elements used across the site (`header`, `nav`, `main`, `section`, `article`, `aside`, `footer`)
- Lists and tables included
- Media elements included (images, audio, video + captions track)
- Embedded map included via `iframe`
- Full form page includes many input types and form-related elements
- Styling included via `style.css`, no JavaScript

## Screenshot
Add at least one screenshot after you run the site locally.

1. Create a folder named `screenshots/`
2. Save a screenshot of the homepage as `screenshots/home.png`
3. The image will display here:

![Home page screenshot](screenshots/home.png)

## Notes
- Some media sources use public demo URLs (MDN interactive examples) to keep the repository lightweight.
- Form submission is demo-only (`action="#"`) because no backend is included.
